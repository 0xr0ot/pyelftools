Introduction: what is pyelftools?
---------------------------------

**pyelftools** is a pure-Python library for parsing and analyzing ELF files
and DWARF debugging information.

Pre-requisites
--------------

**pyelftools** needs only Python to run. It works with Python versions 2.6 and
2.7 (Python 3 support is planned but not yet implemented). For hacking on 
**pyelftools** the requirements are a bit more strict, please see the
user's guide (ZZZ: link?)
