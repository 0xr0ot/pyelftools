Preparing a new release
-----------------------

* Run all tests with Python 2.7 before packaging, on Linux
* Make sure new version was updated everywhere appropriate
* Packaging done on Linux
* Run ``python setup.py build sdist`` (no 'upload' yet)
* Untar the created ``dist/pyelftools-x.y.tar.gz`` and make sure
  everything looks ok
* Create a virtual env for Python 2: 
  (``virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2 ~/test/venv/ZZZ``)
* Use that virtual env executable to install the source tarball
* Run some examples with the venv and see they work, and run the test suite
* Now build with upload to send it to PyPi
* Test with pip install from some new virtualenv
* If everything is OK, upload the distribution to BitBucket as well
* The older download can be kept alive for a couple of days
